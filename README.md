# Project Title

Steadfast Support Services

## Purpose / History

A simple starter site for Steadfast Support Services, a small Ohio-based company run by a friend of mine. If the copy grows considerably we'll need to get them on a framework like Drupal, but for now this should be fine.

The design is taken from https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page215/doctor and the images are from https://www.freeimages.com and used with permission.

## TODO

  * Optimize and combine CSS
  * Optimize and combine JS
